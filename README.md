# Movie Cloud API
This movie cloud API allows anyone to get information about the top 1000 movies according to IMDB rating. It uses purely servless cloud technologies, CosmosDB and Azure Functions specifically. I then create a CLI program in Python using argparse to allow user input within a terminal to return the results, the results are JSON however they are returned in a neatly formatted table using the library tabulate.
